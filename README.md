# GPN Stock Risk Analysis
This repository includes a quantitative risk analysis of the Global Payments, Inc. stock.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to assess the risk of investing in Global Payments, Inc. stock.

# Required software and packages
This analysis was created in python with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in the Jupyter Notebook Integrated Development Environment.

# Data
The data that I worked from is a csv of the price history of Global Payments, Inc. for the past year containing 252 rows and 7 columns.

# Techniques
Techniques used include Monte Carlo simulation, Brownian Motion, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

# Limitations
The data set contains a large dip due to the effects of the coronavirus.  This dip is atypical of the performance of the stock during normal conditions.

# Motivation
In late 2018, I conducted a fundamental analysis of the challenges that Global Payments, Inc. was facing at the time, which interestingly included rising interest rates.  I am attracted to the payments industry because multiple disruptive innovations are in the process of changing the industry, such as blockchain and the internet of things.
